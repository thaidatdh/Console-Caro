# Console-Caro
This is a simple console caro game, which is a project in our OOP subject (HCMUS). I use basic algorithms and libraries, it have single player mode which you will play with computer in other side (just random location, i did not add the Alpha-Beta Pruning/Minimax Algorithm).

**note:** After build success, copy Audio folder in SourceCode/Caro/ into the same folder with execute file(.exe)
